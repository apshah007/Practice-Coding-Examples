Shawn will explain the code challenge 

challenge 1 

showBlock is not there   - it is openBlock 

id  = menu_item_ (then the name of the button) 

.split takes in a parameter 
parameters are separator and limit 
give it another string and cut the string Id into 2 parts 

menu_item_home.split(' ') 


$('#menu >li >a)
 .on('click', function() {
 $(this).attr('id')
 
})

these are the ways to take off the menu_item_  so that you can get the id of the button
substring 
slice 
split 
 
string are a character array 
substring is faster for performance of the application 

sometimes it is better to get something working first and then refactor it 
ten characters were taken off from beginning  by substring to get an easier Id to work with 

adding an active class 
discusses document selectors at this point 

review the github answers from others for this project.
