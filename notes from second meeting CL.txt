Challenge #1:

var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
Part 1: Iterate through this array and log out the sum of the numbers in the array to the console.

Part 2: Use the .splice() function to insert the number 6 after the number 2 in the array.

Challenge #2:

<div class=“main-content”>
     <h2>The first Apple laptop cost how much? <span>Answer</span></h2>
</div>
Using jQuery, change the .text( ) of “Answer” to “$6,500”.


Challenge 1 attempt
var x=0; 
var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; 
for array[x], x<4, x++ 
 {
  array.splice [x]; 
 }

Challenge 2 attempt 
<div class=“main-content”>
     <h2>The first Apple laptop cost how much? <span>Answer</span></h2>
</div>

main-content.span = "6,500"

project expectations 

november 18, Friday before thanksgiving 
posted on slack, all the project requirements 
show off to a potential employer 
link to github - project to shine
people should pick what they are interested in 
these are on the github wiki 
app must be responsive, must react to size of browser,  media queries or break points 
front end  html, css and JS   may use bootstrap 
mean stack - mongo node - back end 
express, have to have a database and have to have server side communication 
must be in github 
must have comments in your code 
this is the part where I call the database 
there must be a readme file with a quick overview of what the project is 
must have any requirements needed to run the project 
url of something - or packages that have to be installed (npm) 

MVC pattern - style of development 
separate your code out 
one section handles user interface 
another with where the data is manipulated 
there must be some sort of clear model of what is going on 
keep clean code 
try to follow design principals 

crud  - create, read update and delete 
the project must read and create (post and get) 
must use mongo db 
what are projects supposed to be 
webapp - solve a problem in your life 
but must demonstrate the principals 
API - application programming interface.  use data from someone elses database 
time tracking app for work 
user friendly dummy pages - build skeleton website, edit profile 
create a social media profile 

Ways to find a project 
list of pains 
think of ways to fix the problem 
check to see if the fix can be made through a web application 

use google maps to find routes and these can be integrated into app 
how to fix and make it better 
evaluate the idea - how can technology help with this 
plans to post this on slack tonight 
project, - front end, database and mean stack 

must break this down in to components 
users 
data needed 
what is being done with the data 
will you need to read, input or evaluate the data 

features could be replaced by packages on the javascript stack 
UI - may use bootstrap to set up columns 
need to focus on functionality 
not the way it looks 

passport local  - node package that already handles login and log out  
need to build the interface -  using this is more easy 

someone has probably already done it 
may add in other peoples work  and customize it for your work 

dont add too many features in for this 
this project does not have to be complete 
there is a deadline and there is no extension 
keep UI principals in place, have some feedback for the user 
follow good programming principals 
test the program - have others test the program with you 
week 10 or 11 this project must be relatively complete and testable 

fewer features are better and software is never done it is just release 
lean startup 
it may be terrible product and it can be improved 
need to do bug fixing  and more things to do 

quick demo for this class today 
thinking about project right now 
content generation 
coding is difficult because you are still learning 
need to commit more and push more to github, best ways to get help is to put it in the github repo 
you dont have the knowledge yet to do the whole project 

need to come up with an idea now 
databases are perhaps complication 
need to read and write from a database 
single database is ok, it does not have to be complex 
treehouse will go over some of the hosting 

fluid host - cheap 
html, ccs, js - github pages - free website where they will post it for free 
project design software - wireframe, balsamic, whiteboard, free license for envision to animate things 
balsamic has some pictures already made up, you dont have to sketch up some things 
envision can create a sketch and then move to the next one  you can only do one project free 

lynda.com   "Invision" 

app from a recent graduate 
works with a small woodworking shop 
quickly communicate and sketch designs together 
3wirechat 
 
login system   register an email and password 
create an account and sign up    - - passport local 
chat feature - node js and angular on front end and stored on mongo db  fetched on realtime 
you can have 2 users 

calculator for the wood that is needed for the project 
creates a list for what you need for a project 
post and write 
read when you add something 

incomplete features - 
has responsive designs - 
angular has templates that allow tabs 

chat function socket.io (node package) that handles all the communication 
express js is part of the mean stack 

code challenge - problems 
making changes in app.js 

copy the cdn version 
need to include the jquery library 
add it to the html file in the script tag 
must tell the website to add jquery 
may download jquery or use a cdn - content delivery network (streamlined for very quick download) 
all the instructions for jquery to be downloaded 
need to link out to the cdn, line of script that needs to be read to find the jquery library 

stay consistent with the version that you are using 
always use google cdn, may do an exception to make sure your cdn is right 
jquery is javascript code, it is easier to have the js in a separate file 



this code should be at the end of the html file to call the js file which has all the scripting in it 
<script src = "http://url,,,.js"
<script src = js/app.js" type="text/javascript" charset ="utf-8"
</body>
</html>

second prompt is to - on hover over a sign flash card show it 
when you stop hovering hide it 

$('flash-card').hover(
function(){                             // handler in    
 $(this).children('.answer').show()
},
function(){                             // handler out 
 $(this).children(.'answer').hide();
}
);

hover has a property of handler in and handler out 
.hover is function used - 2 parameters that can be passed to the hover function 
these are placeholders for a function 
uses an anonymous function 
if you name the function you can call it by way 

need to work on the code challenge for this week again  - it was the flashcards 

also need to work on forking github again 

make sure you are getting the right assignment from the code louisville github site 
look at the jquery website to look over the different jquery properties 

.this selector  flashcard (parent) 
.children - both of the spans 

further narrowing the children to the ones with the class of answer 
.children('.answer')...

may be able to toggle the code
$(this).children('.answer').toggle();

may use mouseover and mouseout instead of using the hover function - use in jquery 
hover is probably one more layer 
hover might be cleaner use of code 
less code and cleaner may not be easier to understand 

have the button on the bottom flips all the answers on and off and - show all the answers 
var cheating = false; 
$('.cheat-button').click()
  function(){
    cheating = !cheating; 
    if (cheating){
      $('.answer').show();
      $(this).text('Hide all the answers');
   }
else{
  $('.answer).hide();
  $(this).text('Show all answers');
}
}

2 alternative approaches 
use hover to check 
use the text of the button to determine state of the flashcards 
} 

mentors names 
Joey 
Shawn 
Gary 
another mentor is starting 

new challenge for next week 
create a new folder and new repository 
attempt to merge locally with the changes to code louisville 

need to go to github
fork it 
then clone it on the terminal 

cd github
gh clone

deny conformity - shauvon website

add all the changes 
git add -A    or git add .
git add test.js 

stage evertything to be committed then commit them 
stage the small changes then commit them 
dont do all the commits at once 

git commit -m " changed app js   fixed a bug "

git push 
if you clone it down, then the local repo know about the remote location 
can add things manually 

git status 
when you clone something down, you have to move to the lower directory 
git status tells you what file you are working on right now 

red means not added or committed 
green means added but not committed 

this will tell you where you are in relation to git hub 
it remembers that you change the file 

undo changes 
git checkout    - give me what I used to have 
challenges/week3/test.js 
git status done again - the copy is not there anymore.
