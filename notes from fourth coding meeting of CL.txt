infrastructure and systems
support 
architect 
business analyst 
project manager 
sales. solutions 
management 

software development life cycle  SDLC

knowledge of coding comes in at all different levels of the SDLC
can apply the knowledge elsewhere 
everything I am about to say to night is in general 
based on the company that is affected and you are working for 

front end jobs - building the part that the user interacts with
 
everything we are doing in this class falls under front end jobs 

user experience - how does the user feel when they are using the program 
really advanced development has emotional experiences 
aesthetic choices 
lesser known -- pure design or mock up work 
building mockups in photoshop or balsamic   
this is not a separate role in a small or medium size company 

UI and UX are sometimes separate and sometimes together 

Back end dev -- 
logic with how something works 
is it writing to a database 
back end type work - - C#, python, ruby, C, C++, java, php, javascript can be back end as well 
mean stack - expansion, now a front end and a back end technology 

software developer 
language developer 

generic titles --- 
systems analyst 
business analyst 


front end -- web developer 
programmer   js developer

3 subroles 
UI - what is build
UX - what the user actually experiences from the product 
Mock ups and design 


.NET engineer  - familiar with .NET  use C#
you should always understand the job clearly before you accept anything 
mongo - SQL  structured query language 
select star from the table user   
joining data from tables and make a complex report 
database work can get into analytics 
research medical field == data mining 
working with large amts of data 


back end or database are the same job 
database dev - database maintenance in large companies is a job 
maintain the server  or maintain the data 


testing QA - act like a user and can use coding 
load testing  - simulate thousands of users to see if the code will break 
every time you make a change to the application you can run a script to see if the program breaks 
testing - is very critical to integrity of the program 

selenium - saves a script and runs it over 
code in selenium and find elements and insert code there 
to test the application 
ways to test an application 
first impression is that it is an afterthought - but should not be 
start developers are the qa team 
for every developer there might be 1-2 qa roles   


student is doing qa  - she works for zirmed and tests sql 
discusses her job position, do qa really need to know code 
she found that doing code is important for doing her job 
qa is not a lower role despite what some people think 
good sign when developers appreciate the qa person 
frustration to want to move on to the next feature instead of qa the current one 

infrastructure and systems 
not physical hardware 
one piece of hardware simulates multiple server 
cloud is just someone elses server 
amazon web service - largest cloud service, they will rent it out to you per hours 
for up to 1 year can get free service 

coding can play a lot with infrastructure 
generate reports in IS field 
netflix user to be on amazon servers. 
they had a good scripting system to help them remember what servers they needed 
this was to simulate peak times with people interest in watching movies 
this is coding to say what service to turn on and when to turn it on 

support 
tech support    email support   video support 
coding can help but it depends on what level you are on 
tier 1 - front desk - password reset 
tier 2 - knows more 
tier 3 - can be a developer  knows most 
developer might be talking to a customer to figure out a bug 

user encountered this issues = support to help find the bug 
student had a coworker who was in tier 2 support tech field 
coworker wrote apps that helped him to do his work 

architect - high level role, system designer, lays out a solution 
may or may not be writing code 
very high level developer 

business analyst - general term   the most common is to deal with requirements for the system
figure out what the system needs to do and then pass it all to the developers to help them build the program 
may be basic or may be more technical 
it is a go between for the client and developer 

project manager - experienced role 
jr project manager - not the management   
they focus on the project   not the hiring or firing 
there are exceptions to that 
they are like a traffic cop to help with rules 
they do all kinds of things something different everyday 
need to know a little bit about what everyone does   need to know about testing, what a dev does 
keep people on deadlines 

sales.  solution 
may be simple, may need technical people to see their product 
communicate what the person needs to the developer sometimes 
solutions architect - more technical sales role

they need this system that does a certain thing 
management, technical or function manager (low level or C level position (ceo, cio, etc) ) 

Dev OPs 
what does it mean?
is this a new term or a fad?
in bw pure hardware and pure developer workers 
bridge hardware and code 
larger companies are more hiring dev ops - they feel they can get more out of an employee 
large conglomerate jobs - google, etc  - looking at big picture helps 

movement towards using platform as a service model 
like hiroku 
pay someone else to deal with hardware
you dont need the dev ops person then 

go with the sales person to a meeting to talk about what the requirements are needed 

field engineering   - bw qa and dev 
large projects with big teams   must coordinate 
for example need to coordinate git 

smaller companies are where you do all the jobs 
do all the SDLC roles in one job
